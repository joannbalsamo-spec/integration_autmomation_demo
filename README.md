Identity-Aware Integration Architecture Demo

Overview
This repository contains a demonstration workbook designed to model identity-aware SaaS integrations in K–12 environments.

The workbook illustrates:
  • Configuration normalization
  • LTI-style launch parameter modeling
  • Environment-aware setup logic
  • Governance-aware implementation tracking
  • Communication and documentation automation patterns

All environments, domains, and references are synthetic and used for modeling purposes only.

This file does not contain production data, client information, proprietary platform details, or real credentials.

Purpose

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how implementation tooling can embed:
  • Governance clarity
  • Decision-right visibility
  • Configuration discipline
  • Workflow orchestration logic
...directly into structured operational artifacts.

This is a systems design exercise and architectural demonstration.
